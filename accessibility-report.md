# Project Accessibility Report

### 1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle.

#### Equitable Use
- The app has a text to speech feature for those who have vision disabilities.
- The app has a speech to text feature for those who have hearing disabilities.
- Sign language compatability is built into the app.

#### Flexibility in Use
- The text to speech feature can be edited to change preferred voice type, speed and pitch.
- The buttons on the app light up when hovered over, making it easy to know what is going to be pressed.
- The user is able to choose from 4 languages to translate transcriptions to.

#### Simple and Intuitive Use
- Each button works with one click, so the entry to use is very low
- The text to speech speed can be adjusted according to the speed the user is comfortable with.
- Each piece of information (the webcam, sign-language translation, and voice transcription) are clearly displayed in 
their own spaces.

#### Perceptible Information
- The app has both visual and verbal output for the user.
- The colours are chosen to give contrast between text and backgrounds.
- Buttons have different text and colour to differentiate them.

#### Tolerance for Error
- The languages for translations is displayed as a drop-down menu with set languages instead of a text box as to not 
work with a language the app doesn't function with.
- The sliders for text to speech customization are set to not go past the TTS API's boundaries.
- Speech to text transcription has a start and stop button so the app doesn't record unwanted/irrelevant audio.

#### Low Physical Effort
- Use cases can be accessed with only the click of a button, no need for overly tedious navigation.
- The buttons on the app are large so someone with low motor skills can still click on them easily.
- Buttons are placed next to each other in order to minimize the movement from button to button.

#### Size and Space for Approach and Use
- Buttons stand out clearly from the background, so they are easily visible.
- Components in the text to speech settings view are close together and easily accessible.
- Sliders in the text to speech settings can be clicked on to move in increments of one if it's easier for the user.
